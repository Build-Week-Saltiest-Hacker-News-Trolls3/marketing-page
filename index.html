                    <h2>What it does:</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever been scrolling down the Hacker News website and realized that there are a lot of
                        salty
                        people? Have you ever wanted to read only those salty comments for your own amusement?
                        Hacker News Saltiest Trolls is the revolutionary app that strives to rank the most saltiest users
                        by their level of saltiness for your
                        own personal entertainment and for your convenience. By aggregating the comments of trolls and
                        ranking them through ‘saltiness’ analysis the app will be able to display the comments of the
                        trolliest users and allow the user to search through their recent comments.</p>

                    <h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
                    <p>The world needs to know the saltiest of the salt. We have to give credit where credit is due. No
                        longer are the times where salty comments go unnoticed and without the recognition they so
                        righteously deserve. We are here to end this issue.</p>
